    ## The role of carbon in the Earth System
    The movement of carbon between land, ocean, and atmospheres is one of the foundations that governs how Earth functions.  Atmospheric CO2 and CH4 play a crucial role in governing global temperatures through absorption of infrared radiation. On land, carbon is the currency shared between plants, microbes, and the atmosphere. Through photosynthesis, plants remove CO2 from the air to support their growth. When plants die or leaves fall to the ground, soil microbes returning much of this CO2 back to the atmosphere through respiration. In flooded wetland soils, where no oxygen is available, microbes known as methanogens produce and release methane gas CH4 rather than CO2. These processes are similar in the ocean, except that atmospheric CO2 first dissolves into the ocean surface before it is used in photosynthesis by tiny plants called phytoplankton. The rate and balance of carbon cycling between land, ocean, and atmosphere is modulated by climate, which includes natural variability and changes driven by warming.

        <Caption> This animation combines data from NASA models and datasets featured on the GHG Center to track the influences on atmospheric CO₂ over the course of a year. Global views highlight the influence of fossil fuel and fire emissions in the atmosphere and land and ocean sinks at the surface using different colors. The waterfall diagram shows the global contributions of major sources and sinks and illustrates how their balance shifts with the season. At the end of the year, the land and ocean have absorbed nearly half of CO₂ emissions. </Caption>

    Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center datasets combine information from ground and space-based observation networks with advanced numerical models to track the net balance between CO₂ uptake (sink) and release (source) to the atmosphere. The land and ocean CO₂ and CH₄ flux datasets accessible from the GHG Center help us understand how both human activities and climate variations are changing atmospheric CO₂ and CH₄ concentrations. This information is needed to support national GHG inventories and assess the efficacy of to monitor the reduction of fossil fuel emissions commitments in a changing climate in support of the Paris Agreement.

    ## Natural sources and sinks of CO₂
    The land and ocean currently absorb around 5 billion metric tons (Pg) of carbon each year from the atmosphere. This amount of carbon is equivalent to around half a year’s worth of CO2 emitted from burning coal, oil, and gas and cement production [any plain language equivalent to highlight?]. Without this assistance from the natural world, CO2 concentrations could rise twice as fast as has been recorded, reducing the time society has to avoid more severe impacts of climate change.
    
    On land, the atmospheric CO₂ removal processes are maintained by forest regrowth, increasing growing season length in the high latitude regions that are warmly more rapidly than the rest of the planet, and from elevated concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere stimulating photosynthesis. In the ocean, carbon uptake is controlled by a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes. Absorption in surface waters tends to increase with rising atmospheric concentrations, but this can be influenced by changes in ocean temperature and circulation.

        Wetlands across temperate and high latitude systems produce less methane than the tropics. Scientists are closely monitoring changes in the high latitudes, which are warming more rapidly than the rest of the planet and store massive amounts of carbon in permafrost.

        ## Natural sources and sinks of CH₄
        Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and while less abundant than CO₂, the increase in atmospheric CH₄ is responsible for about one third of present-day climate change by some estimates. Methane sources are plentiful and represent a mix of human activities [link to use case 1] and natural sources such as wetlands, wildfires, termites, and the ocean. Wetlands are responsible for about 30% of total CH₄ emissions each year. The methane produced in wetlands has a distinctively lighter mass, or isotope, compared to fossil fuel sources, and the increasing abundance of the lighter CH₄ isotope in the atmosphere suggests that wetlands are producing more methane as part of climate-change feedback linked to warming and changing precipitation patterns.

        <Caption>  Though satellites provide valuable observations of ocean temperature, salinity, and productivity from a unique, global perspective, they can not directly measure ocean-atmosphere exchange of CO₂. Models provide additional information that can be used to track how different factors like ocean biology, freshwater input, and changes in heating influence the net absorption of carbon in ocean waters and to predict how these influences may change over time. </Caption>

        <Caption>  Models use observations from NOAA’s network of surface stations and NASA’s OCO-2 satellite to estimate net emissions and removals of CO₂, which reflect the combined impact of fossil fuel emissions and absorption by land and ocean sinks. Variability highlights the role of the 2015-2016 El Nino that resulted in increased emissions from tropical ecosystems as well as large fire events like those in Australia during 2020. </Caption>

        ## Natural sources and sinks in a changing climate
        Climate change and other human activities are impacting sources and sinks and wetland methane emissions in complex ways. Wildfires in forested ecosystems release massive amounts of CO₂ to the atmosphere with the 2020 Australian bushfires and the 2021 high latitude wildfires substantially reducing the net global land sink. Heatwaves and droughts are causing a decline in plant productivity in tropical and temperate ecosystems, which can also lead to a decline in the carbon sink, though in some areas longer growing seasons and changes in vegetation type can increase local uptake. Over oceans, changing circulation patterns and ocean heat waves may be causing weaker carbon uptake in key regions like the Southern Ocean. Precipitation extremes may be linked to increased wetland methane emissions over parts of South America and other tropical regions experiencing increasing warming trends.  

        Disentangling this complex mix of influences requires a mix of observations that track subtle changes over the course of decades and their impact across land, oceans, and atmospheres. In addition to land and ocean models highlighted above, scientists can track recent changes and estimate total emissions using a combination of atmospheric data and circulation models.
