    ## Why be concerned about Greenhouse Gases?

    Multiple agencies within the U.S. Federal Government and partners are able to observe the changing planet.  The data shows trends and patterns in carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) from anthropogenic (human-related) and natural sources that can be used to inform decisions.  NOAA has tracked the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style={{ color: '#0000EE' }}> increase in billion dollar disasters in the USA↗</a> which can be linked to the changing environment.

    ## The US GHG Center Purpose

    The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center (US GHG Center) is a multi-agency effort to integrate greenhouse gas data from observations and models into one environment containing credible, quality-vetted, consensus greenhouse gas emissions and flux products for use in decision-making.
    
    The US GHG Center is built on open source principles and techniques that allow users to access, analyze, visualize and apply data and products to their own usage.
    
    With this wealth of data pertaining to greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas emissions, and related ancillary information, the US GHG Center can be used to increase understanding of the types of GHG data and measurement platforms to facilitate wider and appropriate usage of GHG information.

    The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center is a partnership of EPA, NASA, NIST and NOAA. These agencies are collaborating to prototype development of the center with the goal of accelerating the production and delivery of actionable, quality vetted greenhouse gas (GHG) information, including a curated collection of GHG datasets, workflows and visualizations from the federal government and non-public sector, NASA, EPA, NOAA and NIST. 
    
    The Center acts as an enabler of collaboration with networks of interagency, international, intergovernmental and private sector partners to increase confidence in setting, assessing, and meeting climate mitigation goals.
    
    The US GHG Center is more than just a funnel for greenhouse gas datasets packaged into a user interface. The US GHG Center also includes and reports on various efforts to engage stakeholders, increase understanding with webinars and training events, inform communities, empower users with decision insights.

    ## Relationship to other GHG activities
    The Greenhouse Gas Monitoring & Measurement Interagency Working Group(IWG) was created in January 2022 to coordinate an approach that brings together Federal, subnational, commercial, philanthropic, and academic capabilities to accelerate the Nation’s progress towards an integrated GHG monitoring and information system that supports the Administration’s GHG reduction goals and mitigation efforts.
    
    The IWG has come up with a National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Monitoring & Information System (U.S. GHGMIS).
    
    The U.S. Government plans to use a phased approach in implementing the National Strategy, with Phase 1 taking advantage of, and integrating, mature research capabilities and existing data, and Phase 2 reflecting a more robust monitoring and information system based on well-defined requirements as well as planning and R&D efforts from phase1.  
    
    The US GHG Center informs (or supports) both phases of the implementation of the National Strategy, following an  iterative approach, which begins with integration of capabilities from NASA, NIST, NOAA, and EPA, and is expected to expand and include other agency and non-federal capabilities in the future.
    
    The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center also coordinates with networks of international organizations — including the World Meteorological Organization, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, and the UN Environment’s International Methane Emissions Observatory — to accelerate development and dissemination of GHG MMRV decision support tools and data and establish criteria for thorough evaluation of the quality, accessibility, and transparency of new products.

    ## What are the datasets and Why these?

    The US GHG Center contains credible,quality-vetted, trusted, consensus greenhouse gas emissions and flux products.
    
    The initial 2-yr demonstration phase or the project  targets three GHG areas of study in order to  
        - Provide more accessible anthropogenic gas emission inventories; 
        - Complement anthropogenic GHG emissions with natural GHG emissions and fluxes; and,  
        - Identify and quantify emissions from large methane (CH₄) leak events leveraging aircraft and space-borne instruments.
