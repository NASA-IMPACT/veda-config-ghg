    The Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network for the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) Group is part of NOAA'S Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) in Boulder, CO, USA. The Reference Network measures the atmospheric distribution and trends of the three main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO) which is an important indicator of air pollution. The Reference Network includes measurements of discrete air samples collected with programmable 12-flask packages deployed at tall tower and various field campaign sites in the continental USA and at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The Programmable Flask Package (PFP) flask-air samples are analyzed for up to 55 trace gases at NOAA GML in Boulder as well as for stable isotopes of CO2 and CH4 at the University of Colorado Stable Isotope Laboratory. At tall tower and observatory sites, GML makes in situ measurements for CO2 and CH4, N2O and CO at a subset of sites. The PFPs provide multiple species information and also are part of a larger quality control system.

    Presented here are PFP CO2 dry air mole fractions from air samples collected in glass flasks from 28 NOAA GML Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network sites across the United States. Measurements were taken using a nondispersive infrared absorption analyzer (NDIR) or a cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS). Note: the switch from NDIR to CRDS happened in August 2019. Data are provided in NetCDF and ASCII text and were sampled from 2005-present. Measurements are reported in units of micromol/mol (10^-6 mol CO2 per mol of dry air or parts per million (ppm)). The readme for the dataset can be found here:  https://gml.noaa.gov/aftp/data/trace_gases/co2/pfp/surface/README_surface_pfp_co2.html, and sampling locations can be viewed here: https://gml.noaa.gov/dv/site/?program=ccgg.
